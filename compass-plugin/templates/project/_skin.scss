// Style the pages themselves here.
// To keep things tidy it is recommended that only pages get styled here.
// UI elements should be styled in the "chrome" directory.

// BASE SIZE TO BE USED THROUGHOUT STYLES
// This must be a fixed unit of measurement, usually correlating to your text size.
$base-size: 16px;

// Choose a ratio you wish to use with the modular scale.
$ratio: $fourth;

// TYPE
// Set the default size and leading for columns. Everything line-height in your columns needs to be a multiple of the line-height defined here.
$size: 1em;

// Basing the modular scale off of ems for this.
$line-height: ms(1, 1em);

// METRICS
// Number of columns you want to calculate:
$columns: 12;

// Page measurements:
// ms(n) refers to the position on a built-in modular scale where "n" is the position. However you can use any value you like.
$column: ms(5);
$gutter: ms(1);
$margin: ms(1);
$top: ms(2);

// IMAGE/PAGE RATIOS
// If you wish to scale images and have fixed page sizes image ratios are a must. This allows images sizes to be measured for Treesaver.
// Image sizes still need to be hard coded for lightboxes.

// COLUMN WIDTHS
// If you have a set of grids with a different column width, define it here. The department grid is here as an example but it is only necessary to list the ones with a different size column from the standard width.
// Column widths are measured by grid columns. The default should usually be 3 as that is what the image sizes are based on.

// TYPOGRAPHIC STYLES
// Keep vertical spacing and all line-height attributes a multiple of your line-height to avoid text flow bugs. Do not use "!important" on any measurements here
// Only use system fonts for paragraphs and other large bodies of text. If web fonts are used line endings will be missing or duplicated.
